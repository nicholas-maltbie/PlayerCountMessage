# PlayerCountMessage
This is source code for the bukkit plugin (https://bukkit.org/) that allows a user to create a animated message of the day. The most recent version of Minecraft has broken the plugin (sadly) and this code does not work. Although, for information on how to use the plugin for the intended version, this page from the project site has information: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/player-count-message/pages/a/usage/tutorial/.

Feel free to modify, reuse, or update the code. I only request that you cite me somewhere in the process. (as long it is code that I wrote. If it is borrowed code, cite the original creator, they did all that magic)
